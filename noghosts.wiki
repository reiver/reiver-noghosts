§ noghosts

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**noghosts** is an [[art-series]] by me (i.e., **Charles Iliya Krempeaux**).

§§ Name

The name is based on something I heard my son say when he was 2 years old — it was something like:

― Don't worry, there are no ghosts.

(Apparently there is a game he plays with his mother and sister, where he reassures them there aren't any ghosts.)

And thus the name of this [[art-series]]: **noghosts**.

§ Theme

The **theme** of this [[art-series]] is **ghosts**.
